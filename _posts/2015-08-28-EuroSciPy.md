Hello.
My name is ZdenÄ›k and I am a PhD student of astrophysics
at Department of Theoretical physics and Astrophysics
at Faculty of Science of Masaryk University in Brno,
which is in Czech republic.

Mainly with my supervisor Viktor,
we are preparing educational material
for the new subject

<center>**Numerical methods in astrophysics**.</center>

Using interactive capabilities of IPython notebook
and simplicity of Python language,
we are trying change a mind of ours students
about a computer.
From a *thing* to the *tool*
for effective solving of their physical,
respectively astrophysical,
problems.

The benefits of Python
as their main programming language
are illustrated by comparison of implementation
of the same algorithm in Fortran,
as another frequently used language
for scientific computing.

And by the way,
we want teach the students
how to use Git
for teamwork.

Thank you ;-)
